Filled container:
Container contains 11 elements.
1: It is RECTANGLE
Angles' coordinates are: a.X = 67 a.Y = 89, b.X = 34, b.Y = 67, color = DARK_BLUE, perimeter = 110

2: It is CIRCLE
Center coordinates are: X = 45 Y = 0, radius = 3, color = GREEN, perimeter = 18.8496

3: It is TRIANGLE
Angles' coordinates are: a.X = 11 a.Y = 11, b.X = 11, b.Y = 22 c.X = 33 c.Y = 44, color = YELLOW, perimeter = 81.7738

4: It is CIRCLE
But radius was below zero, so it does not exist
