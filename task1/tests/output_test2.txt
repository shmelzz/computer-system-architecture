Filled container:
Container contains 11 elements.
1: It is RECTANGLE
Angles' coordinates are: a.X = 67 a.Y = 89, b.X = 34, b.Y = 67, color = DARK_BLUE, perimeter = 110.000000

2: It is CIRCLE
Center coordinates are: X = 45 Y = 0, radius = 3, color = GREEN, perimeter = 18.849556

3: It is TRIANGLE
Angles' coordinates are: a.X = 11 a.Y = 11, b.X = 11, b.Y = 22 c.X = 33 c.Y = 44, color = YELLOW, perimeter = 81.773762

4: It is CIRCLE
But radius was below zero, so it does not exist

5: It is RECTANGLE
Angles' coordinates are: a.X = 56 a.Y = 2, b.X = 35, b.Y = 78, color = BLUE, perimeter = 194.000000

6: It is CIRCLE
Center coordinates are: X = 45 Y = 23, radius = 89, color = ORANGE, perimeter = 559.203492

7: It is TRIANGLE

8: It is RECTANGLE
Angles' coordinates are: a.X = 78 a.Y = 45, b.X = 23, b.Y = 87, color = GREEN, perimeter = 194.000000

9: It is RECTANGLE
Angles' coordinates are: a.X = 1 a.Y = 2, b.X = 2, b.Y = 1, color = ORANGE, perimeter = 4.000000

10: It is RECTANGLE
